        # Introduction␊
        ␊
        This API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API accepts [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.␊
        ␊
        # Content Type␊
        ␊
        All requests must be encoded as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the API, including errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.␊
        ␊
        # Rate Limits␊
        ␊
        With the public, non-authenticated version of the API, we limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time. Rate limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:␊
        ␊
        | Header | Description |␊
        | ------ | ----------- |␊
        | `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make. |␊
        | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |␊
        | `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |␊
        ␊
        When the rate limit is **exceeded**, an error is returned with the status "**429 Too Many Requests**":␊
        ␊
        ```json␊
        {␊
          "error": {␊
            "code": "too_many_requests",␊
            "message": "Rate limit exceeded"␊
          }␊
        }␊
        ```␊
        ␊
        # Errors␊
        ␊
        This API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, endpoint not found, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our API (these are rare).␊
        ␊
        ␊
        # Versioning␊
        ␊
        API versions are **immutable** which guarantees that once you have a working integration, it will always be completely optional to upgrade to newer versions.␊
        ␊
        When we make backwards-incompatible changes to an API, we release new versions following [semver](https://semver.org/). The current version is `v1`.␊
        ␊
