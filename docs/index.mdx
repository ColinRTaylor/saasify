## Intro

You can think of Fin as the "**Shopify for SaaS**."

Fin allows you to take a group of serverless functions and easily create a fully functional SaaS website that's capable of monetizing those functions.

This allows makers to:

1) Focus only on their unique value proposition instead of rebuilding standard SaaS boilerplate.
2) Ship and start validating product / market fit in minutes instead of months.
3) Easily monetize existing OSS.
