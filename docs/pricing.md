# Pricing

!> Saasify is an early beta and we're still figuring out an ideal pricing solution. If you're interested in being an early adopter, we're very open to working with you to figure out a pricing solution that will work for you while still covering for our fixed costs. Please don't hesitate to [schedule a call](https://calendly.com/travis-fischer) with us to discuss!

The Saasify platform's default pricing is to take **20%** of all revenue generated from SaaS subscriptions. This is used to pay for Stripe fees, hosting costs, support, and continued product development.

Our [core mission and main objective](./mission.md), however, is to help OSS authors fund their passion via passive income, so during our initial beta period, if you're interested in a different pricing model, feel free to [schedule a call](https://calendly.com/travis-fischer) with us to discuss.

!> All payment-related data is securely handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

It's important to note that no matter what, Saasify only makes money if you make money, so it's in our best interest to help your SaaS product become successful.

Once your SaaS product starts bringing in revenue, you'll be able to initiate or schedule cashouts via [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).

As of October, 2019, we currently don't support an automated way of connecting your Stripe Connect account or initiating a payout, but this feature is on our near-term [roadmap](./roadmap.md). For the time being, we recommend emailing us at [support@saasify.sh](mailto:support@saasify.sh) to work out the details.
