# Serverless

In addition to externally hosted APIs, we also provide built-in support for monetizing serverless functions. This feature is built on top of [ZEIT now](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction ':target=_blank'), which itself runs on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ ':target=_blank').

This is an advanced feature that adds additional complexity to your Saasify project, so we recommend that most makers start off with an externally hosted API that's built using your preferred tech stack and deployment platform of choice.

Some of the existing Saasify [examples](examples.md) use this feature, for instance, to simplify OpenAPI generation and serverless hosting into one step, but we do not recommend this approach for new projects at this time.

Please [contact us](support.md) if you're interested in learning more about serverless hosting with Saasify.
