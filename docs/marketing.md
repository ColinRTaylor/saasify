# Marketing

Here are some recommendations to get started:

- If your SaaS project is based on an open source library, we recommend posting a link to the hosted SaaS version of your library on your open source repo and/or site.
- Posting a `curl` example as answers to relevant questions on Stackoverflow and GitHub issues can be a great way to give developers a taste of your solution to a common problem. We recommend searching through and posting helpful comments on Stackoverflow, Reddit, GitHub, HackerNews, etc.
