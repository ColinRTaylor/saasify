<h2 align="center" class='subtitle'>The easiest way to launch your own SaaS!</h2>

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/saasify.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/saasify) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/saasify-sh/saasify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/saasify-sh/saasify) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

At its core, Saasify transforms **serverless functions** into fully functional **SaaS** websites.

You can think of it as the "Shopify for SaaS". Just like how Shopify allows anyone to create their own e-commerce business online, Saasify allows any developer to easily create their own SaaS API business.

## Demo

Here is a fully functional [example SaaS website](https://puppet-master.sh ':target=_blank') that was generated with Saasify from this [source code](https://github.com/saasify-sh/puppet-master ':target=_blank').

## Why Saasify?

Saasify is an ideal solution for developers who want to earn passive income.

It allows makers to:

1. Focus only on unique value instead of boilerplate 🔥
2. Ship and start evaluating product / market fit in minutes instead of months ✈️
3. Monetize OSS ⭐️
