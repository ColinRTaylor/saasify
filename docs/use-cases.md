  - Offering paid access to proprietary datasets
- Developer tools

- Your NPM module or PyPI package?
  - Offering a hosted, paid version of your OSS work can be a great way to sustain yourself as an indie developer.

Have an idea that you'd like to monetize, but not sure where to start? Feel free to [get in touch](support.md). Our active community is full of passionate indie makers just like you who'd be happy to help.

## Serverless

In addition to externally hosted APIs, we also provide built-in support for monetizing serverless functions built on top of ZEIT now (which runs on AWS Lambda).

This is an advanced feature that adds additional complexity to your Saasify project, so we recommend that most makers start off with an externally hosted API that's built using your tech stack and deployment platform of choice.

Please [contact us](support.md) if you're interested in learning more about serverless hosting with Saasify.
