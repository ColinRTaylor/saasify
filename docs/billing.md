# Billing

!> All payment-related data is securely handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

The Saasify platform takes **20%** of all revenue generated from SaaS subscriptions. This is used to pay for Stripe fees, hosting costs, support, and continued product development.

It's important to note that Saasify only makes money if you make money, so it's in our best interest to help your SaaS product become successful.

Once your SaaS product starts bringing in revenue, you'll be able to initiate or schedule cashouts via [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).

As of October, 2019, we currently don't support an automated way of connecting your Stripe Connect account or initiating a payout, but this feature is on our near-term [roadmap](./roadmap.md). For the time being, we recommend emailing us at [support@saasify.sh](mailto:support@saasify.sh) to work out the details.
