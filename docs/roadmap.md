# Roadmap

Saasify's goal is to become the **Shopify for SaaS**.

Just like how Shopify has helped millions of people start their own e-commerce businesses, Saasify's goal is to provide the world's best solution for makers to start their own SaaS business.

Saasify's current solution is focused on making it as easy as possible to launch **API-first SaaS products**, and we'll be gradually adding support over time for more types of SaaS products.

To achieve these goals as a platform, we'll be focused on a few key areas of product development:

- Going from a "SaaS in a box" solution to offering embeddable SaaS components for any website.
- Offering additional pre-built templates for common SaaS product patterns & verticals.
- Offering additional product add-ons that every SaaS business needs to scale (e.g., CRM, analytics insights, support tools, marketing automation, etc.)
- Building a community of successful indie makers who've bootstrapped their products with Saasify.

Feel free to join in the conversation today and help guide our roadmap via [Slack](https://slack.saasify.sh) and [GitHub](https://github.com/saasify-sh/saasify).
