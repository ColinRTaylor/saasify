## Concepts

#### Service

A `Service` is a single monetizable serverless function. It is written in TypeScript and configured via its parent `Project`.

Services conform to the [Functional TypeScript](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/functional-typescript) specification which. This strong typing allows Saasify to automatically generate documentation, client SDKs, and examples for services.

By default, every service deployed on Saasify is publicly available and rate-limited by IP address. Other developers can *subscribe* to your Project's API in order to gain access to higher rate limits and usage-based pricing.

#### Project

A `Project` is a collection of related `Services`. It is specified by a Saasify config file `saasify.json` which has the following format:

```ts
class Config {
  version?: number = 1
  name?: string
  alias?: string
  services: Service[]
}

class Service {
  src: string
  name?: string
  route?: string
  amountPerRequest?: number = 1
  amountPerCompute?: number = 1
  timeout?: number = 300000
  authRateLimit?: RateLimit
  noAuthRateLimit?: RateLimit
}

class RateLimit {
  requests?: boolean = true
  requestsInterval?: number = 60000
  requestsMaxPerInterval?: number = 1000
}
```

An example `saasify.json` config file could look like:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "hello-world",
  "services": [
    {
      "src": "functions/hello-world.ts",
      "name": "helloWorld"
    }
  ]
}
```

This config specifies a `Project` named `hello-world` with a single service generated from the specified `src` TypeScript file. All pricing and rate limits will use platform defaults.

#### Deployment

You can deploy your `Projects` by creating immutable `Deployments`.

- `saasify deploy` creates a new deployment
- `saasify logs` prints logs for a deployment
- `saasify ls` lists existing deployments for a given project
- `saasify rm` removes deployments for a given project
