# Fin

> Fin is the easiest way to launch your own SaaS.

## Features

- **$$$**: Monetize your open source projects!
- **Simple**: Quick to setup your own SaaS
- **Productive**: Focus on your unique value prop instead of SaaS boilerplate

- **Compatible**: Generated APIs are usable from any programming language

## Intro

Fin transforms **serverless functions** into fully functional **SaaS** websites!

This allows makers to:

1. Focus only on their unique value proposition instead of rebuilding standard SaaS boilerplate.
2. Ship and start validating product / market fit in minutes instead of months.
3. Easily monetize existing OSS.

## Status

**As of April, 2019, Fin is an active WIP and is not yet ready for general use.**

The backend and developer CLI are complete, and our team is working hard on an MVP of the template-based SaaS website generation.

If you're interested in OSS sustainability and want to follow along with the progress of Fin, please consider starring the [repo](https://github.com/saasify/saasify) and following us on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/saasify). Thanks! ⭐️
