> Saasify is the easiest way to launch your own SaaS.

## Features

- **$$$**: Monetize your open source projects!
- **Simple**: Quick to setup your own SaaS
- **Productive**: Focus on your unique value prop instead of SaaS boilerplate
- **Standard**: Built with TypeScript + Lambda + Stripe
- **Compatible**: Generated APIs are usable from any programming language
- **Automatic**: Saasify handles all docs, hosting, billing, accounts, and support for you
- **Efficient**: Start validating product / market fit in minutes instead of months

## Intro

Saasify transforms **serverless functions** into fully functional **SaaS** websites!

This allows makers to:

1. Focus only on their unique value proposition instead of rebuilding standard SaaS boilerplate.
2. Ship and start validating product / market fit in minutes instead of months.
3. Easily monetize existing OSS.

## Status

**As of August, 2019, Saasify is an active WIP and is not yet ready for general use.**

The backend and developer CLI are complete, and our team is working hard on an MVP of the template-based SaaS website generation.
