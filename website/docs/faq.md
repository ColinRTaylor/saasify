### Why serverless?

Serverless functions are a relatively new concept and are gaining traction very quickly across the developer community. They are the perfect abstraction for defining the core, focused, unique functionality that SaaS APIs aim to monetize.

As for serverless functions themselves, they allow your code to run on-demand and scale automatically both infinitely upwards and down to zero. They are great at minimizing cost in terms of infrastructure and engineering time, largely due to removing operational overhead and reducing the surface area for potential errors.

more information, see [Functional TypeScript](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/functional-typescript), [Why Serverless?](https://serverless.com/learn/overview), and an excellent breakdown on the [Tradeoffs that come with Serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html).

### Can I embed Fin APIs on my own website?

There are so many great ways of creating websites these days, from drag & drop template builders like [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com) and [Wix](https://www.wix.com) to developing your own via React, Vue, etc.

Our short-term goal is to support publishing SaaS websites via a built-in template, but our long-term goal is definitely to support embedding common SaaS functionality for your Fin APIs on any website.

Stay tuned...
