At its core, Saasify transforms **serverless functions** into fully functional **SaaS** websites.

You can think of Saasify as the "Shopify for SaaS". Just like how Shopify allows anyone to create their own e-commerce business online, Saasify allows any developer to easily create their own SaaS API business.

## Demo

Here is a fully functional [example SaaS website](https://puppet-master.sh ':target=_blank') that was fully generated by Saasify from this [source code](https://github.com/saasify-sh/puppet-master ':target=_blank').

1. Focus only on unique value instead of boilerplate üî•
