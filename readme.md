## Demo

Here is a live [SaaS API and marketing site](https://synopsis.saasify.sh ':target=_blank') that was auto-generated with Saasify from this [source code](https://github.com/saasify-sh/synopsis ':target=_blank').

We make it really simple to "saasify" your own projects like this one. Once your API is setup, we handle all the bizdev and support requests for you while ensuring that you receive the majority of revenue in return.

## Why Saasify?

We built Saasify as an ideal solution for developers who'd like to earn passive income.

By making it extremely simple to create SaaS APIs, we're creating new opportunities for devs to monetize their work. And the best part is that this business model scales naturally as usage increases, which means the more popular your project becomes, the more money you can earn!

In a nutshell, we allow makers to:

1. Monetize existing OSS ‚≠êÔ∏è
2. Focus only on unique value instead of SaaS boilerplate üî•
3. Ship an API and start monetizing in minutes instead of months ‚úàÔ∏è

## What can be monetized using Saasify?

Saasify is built around serverless functions, so any functionality that can be wrapped in a serverless function could potentially be monetized.

Some example use cases include:

- Workflow automation (headless chrome / bots)
- Image & media processing tasks
- Data transformations
- General algorithms
- Pre-built machine learning models
- Your NPM module or PyPi package?

Check out the [showcase](https://saasify.sh/#/showcase) for more live examples of projects which have been saasified.
