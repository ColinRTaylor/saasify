<h2 align="center" class='subtitle'>Monetize your OSS projects!</h2>

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/saasify.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/saasify) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/saasify-sh/saasify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/saasify-sh/saasify) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

At its core, Saasify transforms **serverless functions** into fully functional **SaaS** websites.

You can think of Saasify as the "Shopify for SaaS". Just like how Shopify allows anyone to create their own e-commerce business online, Saasify allows any developer to quickly & easily create their own SaaS API business.

## Demo

Here is a fully functional [example SaaS website](https://puppet-master.sh ':target=_blank') that was generated with Saasify from this [source code](https://github.com/saasify-sh/puppet-master ':target=_blank').

## Why Saasify?

We built Saasify as an ideal solution for developers who want to earn passive income.

By making it extremely simple to create SaaS APIs, we're creating new opportunities for developers to monetize their work. And the best part is that this business model scales naturally as usage increases, which means the more popular your project becomes, the more money you can earn!

In a nutshell, we allow makers to:

1. Monetize existing OSS! ‚≠êÔ∏è
2. Focus only on unique value instead of SaaS boilerplate üî•
3. Ship and start monetizing in minutes instead of months ‚úàÔ∏è

## What can be monetized using Saasify?

Saasify is built around serverless functions, so any functionality that can be wrapped in a serverless function could potentially be monetized. With that being said, Saasify won't work for all types of OSS projects.

Some example use cases include:

- Workflow automation (headless chrome)
- Pre-built machine learning models
- Image & media processing tasks
- Data transformations
- General algorithms

Have an idea or an OSS project that you'd like to monetize, but not sure where to start? Feel free to contact us on our open [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/saasify/shared_invite/enQtNzY3NjgyODY5OTU2LTBlNTkwYjI3ODlkOTYxOTY5MzQ3OWM0NTFmOTc5OTdjZWYwMWU2YmIyMzdkZDk0NWRlOTJiN2JmZDYzOWM1MzI). ‚úåÔ∏è
